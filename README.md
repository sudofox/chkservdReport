# Tailwatch Log Analysis Tool
(currently `parse_chkservd.php`)

cPanel's Tailwatch produces a strange log with details about service checks, formatted in an almost unreadable manner. 
My goal for this project is to have a tool that can parse through the log and produce a human-readable report of when services went down, how long they were down for, what it took to get them running again, and so forth.
